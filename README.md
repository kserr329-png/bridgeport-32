Bridgeport Final Resource
========================
This resource contains dynamic NPCs with day/night behavior, teleports, robbery jobs, and a draft ymap with building proxies.
Installation:
1. Upload the zip to your server's resources folder or use txAdmin Files to upload the zip.
2. Extract into a folder named 'bridgeport_final_resource' (or keep the folder name consistent).
3. Add 'ensure bridgeport_final_resource' to server.cfg or enable via txAdmin.
4. Start the server and test. Adjust locations.lua coords or ymap/props in CodeWalker if needed.

Notes:
- The resource tries to add money using QBCore when available. Edit server.lua to support ESX or other frameworks.
- The ymap is a draft; use CodeWalker to import and replace proxies with proper archetypes if desired.
